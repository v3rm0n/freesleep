# FreeSleep

Dynamically set the temperature of your Eight Sleep Pod 2 throughout the night without paying for a subscription.

## How it works

Using the EightSleep API, the application queries the current set temperature of the pod every minute and adjusts it if it's different from the set expected temperature.
